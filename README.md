# E-commerce-Pizza-Sales-report

In Power BI, I designed and developed an interactive dashboard that visually represented the key performance indicators (KPIs) from the sales data. Using a variety of charts, graphs, and filters, I presented insights on sales trends, top-performing categories, and peak order times (days). The dashboard allowed for real-time data exploration, enabling stakeholders to drill down into specific metrics for a more detailed analysis. The user-friendly interface ensured that both the owner and other stakeholders could easily interpret the data, track business performance, and make informed decisions efficiently.

In SQL, I performed data extraction, transformation, and analysis by querying the sales dataset to identify key metrics such as total orders, revenue trends, and customer behavior. I created complex queries to filter and aggregate data, allowing for deeper insights into sales performance over time. By using SQL, I was able to efficiently manage large datasets, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the analysis. This provided a solid foundation for the Power BI dashboard, enhancing the overall reporting process and enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
